	abstract = {We consider a system of two linear and linearly coupled oscillators with ideal impact constraints. Primary resonant energy exchange is investigated by analysis of the slow flow using the action–angle (AA) formalism. Exact inversion of the action-energy dependence for the linear oscillator with impact constraints is not possible. This difficulty, typical for many models of nonlinear oscillators, is circumvented by matching the asymptotic expansions for the linear and impact limits. The obtained energy–action relation enables the complete analysis of the slow flow and the accurate description of the critical delocalization transition. The transition from the localization regime to the energy-exchange regime is captured by prediction of the critical coupling value. Accurate prediction of the delocalization transition requires a detailed account of the coupling energy with appropriate redefinition and optimization of the limiting phase trajectory on the resonant manifold.

abstract={The existence of chaos among the jovian planets is a contested issue. There exists both apparently unassailable evidence that the outer Solar System is chaotic1,2, and that it is not3,4,5. The discrepancy is particularly disturbing given that computed chaos is sometimes due to numerical artefacts6,7. Here, we discount the possibility of numerical artefacts and demonstrate that the discrepancy seen between various investigators is real. It is caused by observational uncertainty in the orbital positions of the jovian planets, which is currently a few parts in 10{\thinspace}million. Within that observational uncertainty, there exist clearly chaotic trajectories with complex structure and Lyapunov times---the timescale for the onset of chaos---ranging from 2{\thinspace}million years to 230{\thinspace}million years, as well as trajectories that show no evidence of chaos over 1{\thinspace}Gyr timescales. Determining the true Lyapunov time of the outer Solar System will require a more accurate observational determination of the orbits of the jovian planets. A full understanding of the nature and consequences of the chaos may require further theoretical development.},

abstract = {Summary Lysogens are common at high bacterial densities, an observation that contrasts with the prevailing view of lysogeny as a low-density refugium strategy. Here, we review the mechanisms regulating lysogeny in complex communities and show that the additive effects of coinfections, diversity and host energic status yield a bimodal distribution of lysogeny as a function of microbial densities. At high cell densities (above 106 cells ml−1 or g−1) and low diversity, coinfections by two or more phages are frequent and excess energy availability stimulates inefficient metabolism. Both mechanisms favour phage integration and characterize the Piggyback-the-Winner dynamic. At low densities (below 105 cells ml−1 or g−1), starvation represses lytic genes and extends the time window for lysogenic commitment, resulting in a higher frequency of coinfections that cause integration. This pattern follows the predictions of the refugium hypothesis. At intermediary densities (between 105 and 106 cells ml−1 or g−1), encounter rates and efficient energy metabolism favour lysis. This may involve Kill-the-Winner lytic dynamics and induction. Based on these three regimes, we propose a framework wherein phage integration occurs more frequently at both ends of the host density gradient, with distinct underlying molecular mechanisms (coinfections and host metabolism) dominating at each extreme.},

    abstract = { Loss rates and loss processes for viruses in coastal seawater from the Gulf of Mexico were estimated with three different marine bacteriophages. Decay rates in the absence of sunlight ranged from 0.009 to 0.028 h-1, with different viruses decaying at different rates. In part, decay was attributed to adsorption by heat-labile particles, since viruses did not decay or decayed very slowly in seawater filtered through a 0.2-μm-pore-size filter (0.2-μm-filtered seawater) and in autoclaved or ultracentrifuged seawater but continued to decay in cyanide-treated seawater. Cyanide did cause decay rates to decrease, however, indicating that biological processes were also involved. The observations that decay rates were often greatly reduced in 0.8- or 1.0-μm-filtered seawater, whereas bacterial numbers were not, suggested that most bacteria were not responsible for the decay. Decay rates were also reduced in 3-μm-filtered or cycloheximide-treated seawater but not in 8-μm-filtered seawater, implying that flagellates consumed viruses. Viruses added to flagellate cultures decayed at 0.15 h-1, corresponding to 3.3 viruses ingested flagellate-1 h-1. Infectivity was very sensitive to solar radiation and, in full sunlight, decay rates were 0.4 to 0.8 h-1. Even when UV-B radiation was blocked, rates were as high as 0.17 h-1. Calculations suggest that in clear oceanic waters exposed to full sunlight, most of the virus decay, averaged over a depth of 200 m, would be attributable to solar radiation. When decay rates were averaged over 24 h for a 10-m coastal water column, loss rates of infectivity attributable to sunlight were similar to those resulting from all other processes combined. Consequently, there should be a strong diel signal in the concentration of infectious viruses. In addition, since sunlight destroys infectivity more quickly than virus particles, a large proportion of the viruses in seawater is probably not infective. }

    abstract = {Life history theory accounts for variations in many traits involved in the reproduction and survival of living organisms, by determining the constraints leading to trade-offs among these different traits. The main life history traits of phages—viruses that infect bacteria—are the multiplication rate in the host, the survivorship of virions in the external environment, and their mode of transmission. By comparing life history traits of 16 phages infecting the bacteria Escherichia coli, we show that their mortality rate is constant with time and negatively correlated to their multiplication rate in the bacterial host. Even though these viruses do not age, this result is in line with the trade-off between survival and reproduction previously observed in numerous aging organisms. Furthermore, a multiple regression shows that the combined effects of two physical parameters, namely, the capsid thickness and the density of the packaged genome, account for 82% of the variation in the mortality rate. The correlations between life history traits and physical characteristics of virions may provide a mechanistic explanation of this trade-off. The fact that this trade-off is present in this very simple biological situation suggests that it might be a fundamental property of evolving entities produced under constraints. Moreover, such a positive correlation between mortality and multiplication reveals an underexplored trade-off in host–parasite interactions.},

Surprisingly, in one high eccentricity solution, a subsequent decrease of Mercury's eccentricity induces a transfer of angular momentum from the giant planets that destabilizes all the terrestrial planets after about 3.34 billion years, with possible collisions of Mercury, Mars or Venus with the Earth.},

However, previous work has typically treated each instance of these dynamics separately. We review both empirical examples and model systems, and outline a classification of transient dynamics based on ideas and concepts from dynamical systems theory. This classification provides ways to understand the likelihood of transients for particular systems, and to guide investigations to determine the timing of sudden switches in dynamics and other characteristics of transients.

abstract = {Summary
The rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has spurred renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages in therapy. However, mechanisms contributing to phage-mediated bacterial clearance in an animal host remain unclear. We investigated the effects of host immunity on the efficacy of phage therapy for acute pneumonia caused by MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a mouse model. Comparing efficacies of phage-curative and prophylactic treatments in healthy immunocompetent, MyD88-deficient, lymphocyte-deficient, and neutrophil-depleted murine hosts revealed that neutrophil-phage synergy is essential for the resolution of pneumonia. Population modeling of in vivo results further showed that neutrophils are required to control both phage-sensitive and emergent phage-resistant variants to clear infection. This “immunophage synergy” contrasts with the paradigm that phage therapy success is largely due to bacterial permissiveness to phage killing. Lastly, therapeutic phages were not cleared by pulmonary immune effector cells and were immunologically well tolerated by lung tissues.}
