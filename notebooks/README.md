## WHAT
This folder contains basic scripts and executable files. Within this folder is the original code that inspired the current code 'sergio_model-artifiact/Metamodel' which contains the code that inspired the more recent code utilized in the manuscript, "Finite Observation Framework Predicts Tipping Points in Transient Dynamics." The one labeled 'theta_heaviside_approach-current' is the code which is used within the current version manuscript and differs from the original code, being inspired but not building off the code.
