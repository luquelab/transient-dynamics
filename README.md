# Transient Dynamics Through Observational Principle Normalization

## WHAT
transient-dynamics.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that generates a simulation of a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system, investigating finite observational principles by calculating the weight per process and classifying it as relevant or irrelevant based upon the inherent observational window set by the user. The inputs for the notebook involve the characteristics of the phage and bacteria population, the observer's observational time, and the ability to perceive change (observer's tolerance). The outputs of the notebook include population, weight, and relative error figures, alongside an Excel file output for all array-like variables produced during analysis and a text file for the float variables produced in calculations.

The quickest way to use transient-dynamics.ipynb is by running it in a Google Colab notebook in the cloud, requiring only a Google account. It can simulate scenarios and can also be run within Conda environments or on Visual Studio Code to simulate the scenarios.

The methodology and application of transient-dynamics.ipynb are available in a published pre-print on the bioRxiv pre-print server:
