# WHAT
This folder contains the data sets for each parameter set, including the intial parameters, graphs (for population change, processes vs time, weights vs time, and error between the full and adaptive model), and lastly the export of the generated values for the agent, weights and error for each point in time. The folder labelled, "sergio_data-legacy" is data from the original model that inspired this new project. The folder labelled, 'transient-dynamics_output-current' contains the data from the current model that is used within the manuscript, as stated previously it contains output files and unedited figures.
